    "Finally, now that we have all of the parts of the GAN framework defined,\n",
    "we can train it. Be mindful that training GANs is somewhat of an art\n",
    "form, as incorrect hyperparameter settings lead to mode collapse with\n",
    "little explanation of what went wrong. Here, we will closely follow\n",
    "Algorithm 1 from Goodfellowâs paper, while abiding by some of the best\n",
    "practices shown in [ganhacks](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks)_.\n",
    "Namely, we will âconstruct different mini-batches for real and fakeâ\n",
    "images, and also adjust Gâs objective function to maximize\n",
    "$logD(G(z))$. Training is split up into two main parts. Part 1\n",
    "updates the Discriminator and Part 2 updates the Generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1 - Train the Discriminator**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall, the goal of training the discriminator is to maximize the\n",
    "probability of correctly classifying a given input as real or fake. In\n",
    "terms of Goodfellow, we wish to âupdate the discriminator by ascending\n",
    "its stochastic gradientâ. Practically, we want to maximize\n",
    "$log(D(x)) + log(1-D(G(z)))$. Due to the separate mini-batch\n",
    "suggestion from ganhacks, we will calculate this in two steps. First, we\n",
    "will construct a batch of real samples from the training set, forward\n",
    "pass through $D$, calculate the loss ($log(D(x))$), then\n",
    "calculate the gradients in a backward pass. Secondly, we will construct\n",
    "a batch of fake samples with the current generator, forward pass this\n",
    "batch through $D$, calculate the loss ($log(1-D(G(z)))$),\n",
    "and *accumulate* the gradients with a backward pass. Now, with the\n",
    "gradients accumulated from both the all-real and all-fake batches, we\n",
    "call a step of the Discriminatorâs optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 2 - Train the Generator**\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in the original paper, we want to train the Generator by\n",
    "minimizing $log(1-D(G(z)))$ in an effort to generate better fakes.\n",
    "As mentioned, this was shown by Goodfellow to not provide sufficient\n",
    "gradients, especially early in the learning process. As a fix, we\n",
    "instead wish to maximize $log(D(G(z)))$. In the code we accomplish\n",
    "this by: classifying the Generator output from Part 1 with the\n",
    "Discriminator, computing Gâs loss *using real labels as GT*, computing\n",
    "Gâs gradients in a backward pass, and finally updating Gâs parameters\n",
    "with an optimizer step. It may seem counter-intuitive to use the real\n",
    "labels as GT labels for the loss function, but this allows us to use the\n",
    "$log(x)$ part of the BCELoss (rather than the $log(1-x)$\n",
    "part) which is exactly what we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will do some statistic reporting and at the end of each\n",
    "epoch we will push our fixed_noise batch through the generator to\n",
    "visually track the progress of Gâs training. The training statistics\n",
    "reported are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Loss_D** - discriminator loss calculated as the sum of losses for\n",
    "   the all real and all fake batches ($log(D(x)) + log(1 - D(G(z)))$).\n",
    "-  **Loss_G** - generator loss calculated as $log(D(G(z)))$\n",
    "-  **D(x)** - the average output (across the batch) of the discriminator\n",
    "   for the all real batch. This should start close to 1 then\n",
    "   theoretically converge to 0.5 when G gets better. Think about why\n",
    "   this is.\n",
    "-  **D(G(z))** - average discriminator outputs for the all fake batch.\n",
    "   The first number is before D is updated and the second number is\n",
    "   after D is updated. These numbers should start near 0 and converge to\n",
    "   0.5 as G gets better. Think about why this is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This step might take a while, depending on how many epochs you\n",
    "run and if you removed some data from the dataset."
